In this Lab we're going to **Create 4 different Maps** that highlight where different people from around the World are doing Malicious things to our Environment since it's been online.

<br>

üåç We're going to Create the following 4 Maps:

| **Map**                   | **Use Case**                                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1Ô∏è              | Failed Authentication against **Windows VMs** (RDP / SMB / General Authentication Failures) |
| 2Ô∏è                | Failed Authentication against **Linux VMs** (SSH)                |
| 3Ô∏è     | Failed Authentication to the **Microsoft SQL Server** (inside our Windows VM)                    |
| 4Ô∏è  | Malicious Inbound Flows for the **Network Security Groups**                    |

<br>

In the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú go to **Microsoft Sentinel** ‚ûú select our **Log Analytics Workspace** ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7049e934-297e-4fd1-aaad-5deef6344015)

<br>

üí°The Maps are Created inside of Workbooks:

So click on the **Workbooks** blade ‚ûú and then ‚ûï **Add Workbook**

<br>

**<summary> üìù Step-by-step Guide on How to Create the Sentinel Maps Inside the Workbooks</summary>**

<br>

We'll first create the **Workbook** & the **Map** for the ***Linux SSH Authentication Failures***

After clicking on ‚ûï **Add Workbook** ‚ûú you can see there's a Default Workbook that Sentinel made.

Click ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04809ee5-30cf-4be9-9657-96b40d8570c5)

<br>

There's 2 Elements in the default workbook ‚ûú so we'll üóëÔ∏è **Remove** them both

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd89e261-7b56-40a3-b5f4-67527548db14)

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0713cab8-6708-4559-a1b7-95f32931aa2c)

<br>

Then we're going to click on ‚ûï **Add** ‚ûú and we're going to ùÑú **Add query** based element

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d4e479-6c2b-4a15-9f74-318c9859f61d)

<br>

We'll then click the **</> Advanced Editor blade**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63fdc5d4-3d7c-446a-b534-83432bebd22d)

<br>

Now go to [this GitHub link](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/blob/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON)/linux-ssh-auth-fail.json) to get the **JSON** for the **Linux SSH Failed Authentication Map**.

Copy the **JSON** text.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fd9e66-7334-4611-a0c6-5bdba55f5b11)

<br>

Back in the Azure Portal ‚ûú erase the default text ‚ûú and paste the **JSON** from the GitHub link

Then click ‚úîÔ∏è **Done Editing** down bellow

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9aaa0e83-9d8a-490a-aa5a-410737e21ecb)

<br>

Lastly, we'll click on the üíæ **Save** button:

- **Name the Workbook** ‚ûú ```linux-ssh-auth-fail```

- Make sure you select our **Log Analytics Workspace** ‚ûú ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

- Place the Workbook at he same **Location** as our other Resources ‚ûú ```(US) East US```

Click **"Apply"**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/200974a3-3b28-41d9-82ff-a819e9a5c657)

<br>

‚úÖ The **Workbook** and the corresponding **Sentinel Map** for the **Linux SSH Authentication Failures** were successfuully created.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddd23b87-fec7-464c-8e3c-72e6b77bcb01)

<br>

We'll then continue Creating the rest of the Workbooks & Maps for the rest of the Resources.

We'll click on ‚ûï **Add Workbook** ‚ûú follow the same process ‚ûú  and use the other JSON codes from [this link](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course-v2/tree/main/Sentinel-Maps(JSON))

<br>

  </details>

<h2></h2>

<br>

‚úÖ All 4 Workbooks & Maps were successfully created:

<br>

<br>

<details close> 
  
**<summary> üí° We can then Test the Query ‚ûú to see if Events will be plotted on the Maps.</summary>**

<br>

From inside the **Workbook** ‚ûú click on ‚úèÔ∏è **Edit** ‚ûú and then **‚Üë Edit**

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/10465b3c-25fb-460a-b6c3-29498b002aed)

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5262c279-be91-4257-a9fd-ad75076439f5)

<br>

And then we can see the actual **"Log Analytics Workspace Logs Query"** that's being used to plot stuff on the Map.

üí° If we click on the **"Map Settings"** button we can see all the **Settings** used in conjuction with the **Query** to create the **Attack Map**:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9eadd94c-5998-48e0-8579-9e58355ef924)

<br>

We'll copy this Query from under the ‚öôÔ∏è **Settings"** blade:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9baa1292-e81b-4f7c-b3a4-a2923e843608)

<br>

We'll then go to our Log Analytics Workspace ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01``` ‚ûú and **Paste It** to **Query the Logs**

<br>

  </details>

<br>

For example ‚ûú this is the Query from the **Windows RDP/SMB Authentication Failures** Workbook in LAW:

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed015807-3c97-4def-8d0d-a58b227104b6)

<br>

By doing this, you can test changes to the Query.

‚úÖ This way we make sure it's **Working and Generating Desired Results** ‚ûú before having to Update the Sentinel Workbooks.

<br>

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13b81385-ded0-4e2c-810e-4e2505bdf7c5)

<br>

To Test your **Alerts & Incident Rule Configuration**:

- We'll **Simulate some Attacks on the VMs** and see if they show up in Sentinel (Generate Alerts & Incidents).

<br>

<br>

### ‚û°Ô∏è Here are some Tests to Run:

<br>

#### ‚ù∂ Trigger AAD Brute Force Success:

- Simulate **Brute-Force Success against Azure AD** with your Attacker Account ‚ûú from within the ```attack-vm```.

- In an Incognito Window ‚ûú Open the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú and Fail 10 Consecutive Logins ‚ûú followed by 1 Successful Login.


<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ‚ù∑ Trigger MS SQL Brute Force Attempt:

- We'll use the ```attack-vm``` for this one.

- Open **SSMS** and Simulate **Brute Force Attempt against the SQL Server** by failing 10 Consecutive Logins.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ‚ù∏ Trigger Malware Outbreak:

- From within the ```windows-vm``` ‚ûú Generate a **Malware Alert** by using ***PowerShell*** to create 1 or more **EICAR Files**.

- [Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1](https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Cyber-Course/blob/main/Attack-Scripts/Malware-Generator-EICAR.ps1)

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí°</summary>**
> 
> This can also be done Manually by creating a Text File with an **EICAR String** in it.
> 
>   </details>

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ‚ùπ Trigger Possible Privilege Escalation (AKV Critical Credential Retrieval or Update):

- Manually Read our **Key Vault Secret** ```Tenant-Global-Admin-Password``` in the Azure Portal.

- Observe the **Incidents** in Microsoft Sentinel.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ‚ù∫ Trigger Windows Host Firewall Tampering:

- Manually Enable & Disable the ```windows-vm``` **Firewall**.

- Observe the **Incidents** in Microsoft Sentinel.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

#### ‚ùª Trigger Excessive Password Resets:

- Reset a **User's Password** in the Azure Portal 10 times.

- Observe the **Incidents** in Microsoft Sentinel.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

After each Attack ‚ûú wait 10-20 minutes ‚ûú then check **Sentinel** to see if you have any **Incidents**.
